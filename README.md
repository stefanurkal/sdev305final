# sdev305final

My final project for sdev305 is a website that acts like a giving tree

Describe the features of your app and any known limitations.

The user submits a gift request, much like they would on a bulletin board or giving tree. 
This saves the request and then post this for people to claim in order to buy the gift. 
limitations would be that I was not able to complete the app to claim the gift tag. I tried for hours but could not figure out the best way to have that tag information transfer. 
You are able to sort available gift request by the recipiants age by alphabetical order, or by newest request

If you worked with a partner, describe each of your contributions in detail. Pair programming is greatly encouraged!

I did not work with anyone
